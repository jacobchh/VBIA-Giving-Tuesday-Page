# Giving Tuesday Landing Page - Vancouver Brain Injury Association
Curated and developed a simple Giving Tuesday landing page commissioned by the Vancouver Brain Injury Association. Giving Tuesday is a movement to create an international day of charitable giving at the beginning of the Christmas and holiday seasons to support local communities, charities, and non-profits.

This was my first experience with web development and extremely fun learning on the fly! Utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript for parallax/expansion animations.
